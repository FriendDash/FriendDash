## What is FriendDash?

- Group Order Pick Up App

## Project Description:

FriendDash is a web application that enables users to save time, money, and get their food faster! It is an eco-friendly solution that enables local community members in relatively denser populations to join in an order when one member of the group picks up the order. The application is targeted toward university students and local community members.

Create, browse, or join ongoing orders where a member of the group will pick up the orders received from all members of the group as the group creator. Hungry? Users can easily browse a directory of food orders which displays the restaurant that the order will be made at, an estimated time, as well as a predetermined pickup spot. Users can join in on the order and meet up with the group creator at the predetermined pickup spot. Save time and money by simply joining an ongoing order and meeting up at the pickup spot.

FriendDash will store order history, user reputation/ratings, user profiles/account logins, and user information. Users can create and log in to their accounts and be able to view their profiles and others that have ratings and reviews!
